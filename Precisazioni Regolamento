- Steering systems using cables or belts for actuation are prohibited. [DV ONLY] This does not apply for autonomous steering actuators.

- The vehicle must be equipped with a hydraulic brake system that acts on all four wheels and is operated by a single control.
- The brake system must have two independent hydraulic circuits such that in the case of a leak or failure at any point in the system,
effective braking power is maintained on at least two wheels. Each hydraulic circuit must have its own fluid reserve,
either by the use of separate reservoirs or by the use of a dammed reservoir
- “Brake-by-wire” systems are prohibited. [DV ONLY] In autonomous mode, it is allowed to use “brake-by-wire”.
- The brake pedal and its mounting must be designed to withstand a force of 2 kN without any failure of the brake system or pedal box.
This may be tested by pressing the pedal with the maximum force that can be exerted by any official when seated normally
- A brake pedal over-travel switch must be installed on the vehicle as part of the shutdown circuit, as in EV 6 or CV 4.1.
This switch must be installed so that in the event of a failure in one or both of the brake circuits the brake pedal over travel will result in the shutdown circuit being opened.
This must function for all possible brake pedal and brake balance settings.
- The maximum permitted voltage that may occur between any two electrical connections in the LVS is 60 VDC or 25 VACRMS
- [CV ONLY] The following systems are excluded from the LVS voltage limit, see T 11.1.2:
• High voltage systems for ignition
• High voltage systems for injectors
• Voltages internal to OEM charging systems designed for <60 VDC output.
- A standalone non-programmable circuit, the BSPD, must open the shutdown circuit, see EV 6.1 and CV 4.1, when hard braking occurs,
whilst the throttle position is more than 10 % over idle position, To detect hard braking, a brake system pressure sensor must be used.
The threshold must be chosen such that there are no locked wheels and the brake pressure is ≤ 30 bar.

[DV ONLY] The vehicle must be equipped with an additional engine start button next to the
LVMS, see T 11.3, that can be easily actuated from outside the vehicle. Using the external
engine start button, the engine may only start if
• the ASMS (see DV 2.2) is switched on and
• the gearbox is in neutral.
CV 1.2.3 [DV ONLY] There must be a green light next to the engine start button, that indicates that the
gearbox is in neutral. It must be marked with the letter “N”. This letter must have a minimum
height of 25 mm.
CV 1.2.4 [DV ONLY] The autonomous system must not be able to (re-)start the engine.
